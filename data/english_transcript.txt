1. Hello and welcome to a new episode of Easy French.
2. Today we're in the 10th arrondissement of Paris, one of the new young and trendy neighborhoods of the capital.
3. And we're going to ask Parisians why they decided to move to Paris.
4. Let's go.
5. Do you avoid Paris? No, quite the opposite.
6. Do you live in Paris? No.
7. No.
8. Would you like to live in Paris?
9. Yes, it's less so.
10. And why?
11. I lived there for a few months for my studies.
12. And I really love the cultural offer.
13. And there are so many things going on.
14. Where the time is mainly for that.
15. Okay, now you live in Switzerland.
16. I'm coming back.
17. It's less fun.
18. Switzerland depends on where, but.
19. It's not as good as Paris.
20. Less fun than Paris.
21. Would you like to live in Paris?
22. Yes.
23. A suitcase in Paris.
24. Why would you like to live in Paris?
25. And now if it's our city.
26. Because I work there.
27. And I love it.
28. That's all.
29. Why do you find it particularly beautiful?
30. Whatever the season.
31. And whatever the time of day.
32. I find that there's always exceptional lighting.
33. And that most buildings are very beautiful.
34. And the neighborhoods are completely different.
35. I find traveling from one place to another.
36. Do you live in Paris?
37. Yeah.
38. G8 in Paris.
39. In which neighborhood?
40. I live in the 15th.
41. Okay.
42. Why do you live in Paris and not in another city?
43. I live in Paris because there's a cultural density.
44. That's very Parisian, laughing like that for nothing.
45. We also say.
46. I don't know.
47. Since it's inspiring.
48. Because people are nice.
49. There's always something to do every day.
50. Look.
51. You're showing me that I'm going into streets where there are no people.
52. It's great.
53. It's 3 pm.
54. We're hungry.
55. We can go eat.
56. It's nice.
57. It's better.
58. It's cool, you know?
59. This video.
60. Have you always lived in Paris?
61. No.
62. It's been seven years.
63. And you got engaged here directly.
64. A bit complicated.
65. But it was recognized.
66. Okay.
67. But why Paris and not another city?
68. It's the center for work and studies.
69. Would you like to live in Paris?
70. Yes.
71. Yes.
72. What would be your dream neighborhood?
73. The fifth.
74. Because of Luxembourg.
75. Why?
76. For the garden.
77. The bookstores.
78. The cinema.
79. All the small neighborhood cinemas of the 10th.
80. The charm of this neighborhood.
81. Its height too.
82. I really like it.
83. In that case.
84. If you live in Paris.
85. Yes.
86. I live in Paris.
87. Okay.
88. You live in Paris in the 8th arrondissement.
89. Okay.
90. That's why Paris and not another city?
91. I was born here.
92. I work here.
93. I did my studies between here and the United States.
94. That's it.
95. I'm coming back home.
96. Why Paris and not another island?
97. Because I've always lived in Paris.
98. In any case.
99. I really like the capital.
100. There's everything.
101. It was.
102. I was looking for jobs.
103. I never struggled.
104. And so it's also.
105. Quite easy to live in Paris.
106. Actually.
107. You live in Paris.
108. Yes.
109. Yes.
110. Are you doing well?
111. Enough of the French.
112. Axa.
113. That's a typical Parisian.
114. Very easy.
115. Why do you live in Paris and not in another city?
116. We were just talking about that.
117. Actually.
118. We're stuck in Paris.
119. My dream is to leave elsewhere.
120. But after.
121. It's difficult.
122. We evolve.
123. We have children.
124. We have jobs here.
125. We have couples.
126. Leaving is hard.
127. More difficult.
128. I would love to go to Bordeaux.
129. Why Bordeaux?
130. Why Bordeaux?
131. Because I'm attached to the Southwest.
132. To the people of the Southwest.
133. To the washing.
134. Which is much cooler down there.
135. And it avoids.
136. Before.
137. It would avoid me from suffering from Parisians.
138. For example.
139. Do you live in Paris?
140. Greetings from Lyon station.
141. The second Lyon station.
142. Between Lyon station and Bastille.
143. Why Paris and not another city?
144. I'm a Parisian in my blood.
145. Hot ahead ten in Paris.
146. I don't really have family elsewhere.
147. And yet.
148. I would love to leave again.
149. But I don't know where to go.
150. So.
151. GS.
152. I'm fine.
153. But I don't have.
154. I don't have other fallback options for now.
155. I live in the 14th arrondissement.
156. Rather than in hockey.
157. Have you always lived in Paris?
158. No.
159. No.
160. So I'm a provincial.
161. That's one.
162. And in Picardy.
163. And I've lived in Paris since I work.
164. Okay.
165. And piquant.
166. So.
167. So since I'm 20 years old.
168. With Murphy.
169. More precisely 40 years.
170. Okay.
171. And so you moved to Paris just for work?
172. There were other reasons.
173. For work.
174. But the other reasons.
175. Was that I could continue my studies.
176. Being a Parisian.
177. It was much easier.
178. Do you live in Paris?
179. Yes.
180. Since my birth.
181. Okay.
182. Where?
183. In the 16th.
184. 16th.
185. Okay.
186. Have you always lived in Paris?
187. And why is Paris not our life?
188. Because the world is.
189. No.
190. Yeah.
191. Why is it pretty?
192. What's so good about Paris?
193. Having visited many cities.
194. Really.
195. Having traveled around the world.
196. Paris is magical.
197. Maybe not the Parisians.
198. But the city of Paris.
199. What motivated you.
200. To move to Paris?
201. Because I've just started a new master's degree.
202. In a business school.
203. So that's it.
204. I had to move.
205. Zhang.
206. Bordeaux at base.
207. I feel more at home.
208. In French culture.
209. Than in Germanic culture.
210. So I really like.
211. It's miles.
212. To concerts.
213. A trap question.
214. Raclette.
215. These French.
216. Or 6.6.
217. In Switzerland.
218. No.
219. No.
220. The lah are due.
221. On the other hand.
222. I'm not sure about that.
223. Are there other cities in France that make you want to?
224. Yeah.
225. Yeah.
226. But for now.
227. I'm staying.
228. A lot of work.
229. And said.
230. Yes.
231. Okay.
232. What do you do in life?
233. There?
234. I work for a TV show.
235. You live in such a neighborhood.
236. Where?
237. I had Trevoux left.
238. Okay.
239. Or puces.
240. In the neighborhood near the Invalides.
241. In the ministries neighborhood.
242. Which is much more.
243. Much more bourgeois.
244. And less fun.
245. Than this neighborhood.
246. Yes.
247. Have you always lived in Paris?
248. I've traveled a lot.
249. But I was raised in Paris.
250. Is Paris the city of your dreams?
251. It would have been.
252. Close parent.
253. I understand.
254. To say.
255. I'm leaving.
256. And what?
257. But no.
258. Or not?
259. Did they take you to other cities that make you dream?
260. Well, other cities.
261. Maybe not.
262. But there are other areas in France.
263. Burgundy.
264. Brittany.
265. Which attracts me a lot.
266. But.
267. And again.
268. For now.
269. I don't have a reason to go there.
270. I have more reason to stay in Paris.
271. To work.
272. I work in the 10th arrondissement of Paris.
273. I run a network of entrepreneurs, business leaders.
274. Who are committed.
275. To accompany younger business leaders.
276. So that's it.
277. I connect entrepreneurs.
278. In sixth.
279. Between them.
280. To develop their vocation.
281. Of each company.
282. Okay.
283. And effectively.
284. To create companies.
285. It's practical to be in Paris.
286. So yes.
287. And no.
288. Because actually.
289. There are entrepreneurs.
290. All over France.
291. We have an international network.
292. So we have people.
293. All over the place.
294. Not only in France.
295. But abroad.
296. And what we see.
297. Is that there are entrepreneurs.
298. Everywhere.
299. There's job creation.
300. Everywhere.
301. So in reality.
302. Yes.
303. It's better.
304. When you start a business.
305. Digital especially.
306. In Paris.
307. But it's not necessarily required.
308. And digital champions.
309. Also elsewhere in France.
310. And have you always lived in the 14th arrondissement?
311. No.
312. I first lived in.
313. The Parisian suburbs Gonesse.
314. Then the 15th arrondissement.
315. [Music].
316. Which pieces.
317. Then the 12th arrondissement.
318. And the 14th.
319. For 20 years.
320. [Music].
