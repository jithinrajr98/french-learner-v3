1. We respect the highway code
2. We are on a four-lane road
3. It's just people who work
4. We waste time in Paris
5. We can't drive anymore now
6. It's the périphérique
7. We really wonder if we'll be able to drive anywhere
8. It's 5:19 am
9. It's October 10th
10. It's official, the périphérique is now entirely at 50 km/h
11. It's almost dangerous to drive at 50 at night or early in the morning
12. We are on the busiest axis in France
13. We are on a four-lane road
14. There are over a million vehicles that pass here every day
15. The only time people slow down is when they reach the speed cameras on the périphérique
16. It would have been much more logical to have set hours when you can't exceed 50 km/h
17. And then have hours when you can drive faster
18. But 70 was very, very fine
19. It was neither too fast nor too slow
20. It was really ideal
21. But 50 is frustrating
22. I go home, I'm fed up
23. I come to work, I'm fed up
24. There's not a single moment when we're calm
25. What about those who are awake all night, how do they manage
26. We have a unanimous decision from the city of Paris
27. There are no pedestrians
28. There are no bicycles
29. What's the point
30. It's just that in a few years, they'll put us at 30 km/h
31. They'll put in a bike lane
32. The loop will be closed, quite simply
33. They'll put in little trees so we can look at trees while we drive
34. We already waste time in Paris
35. We can't drive anymore now
36. Three-quarters of accidents on the périphérique involve motorcycles
37. It's never car to car
38. A vehicle that doesn't move for me is a vehicle that pollutes
39. It would have been much more logical to put in noise-reducing asphalt
40. Something that already exists and is on a certain part of the périphérique
41. It makes a real difference
42. We always prefer to target those who work
43. We're just adding to the hardship
44. We're at maximum mental load
45. Even in terms of life expectancy, it's going to affect us
46. We've probably lost a few years
47. We're stressed and anxious from morning to night
48. The average speed of Parisian taxis is constantly decreasing
49. Today, clients at the end of every ride tell us, "no more good day"
50. They say, "good luck, sir"
51. People are very aware of what we go through from morning to night
52. We have a consultation scheduled for December with the City of Paris
53. If I note that there's no improvement for us taxi drivers in Paris
54. Who are neither more nor less than the continuity of public service
55. If I have to wait, I think I'll finish paying off my car
56. I'll do like many of my taxi colleagues
57. They switched to being suburban taxis
58. The mental load is too high
59. We're exhausted
60. If they don't want us, what do you expect us to do
61. We won't force things
62. We transport clients
63. We try to make people use their vehicles less
64. Logically, we should have an advantage
65. But these promises have always been made
66. We've never seen the color of it
67. If we have this policy of not wanting vehicles in Paris, then own it
68. Own the policy you're pursuing
69. If you don't want individual vehicles in Paris, ban vehicles
70. Stop making people go crazy
71. We're really going to end up, we're all going to end up in the asylum
