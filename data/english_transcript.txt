1. We lose our money because in any case, it's done on purpose
2. The codes are calculated on purpose so that it's always the same person who wins
3. Even when we manage to win our money, it's very complicated to recover it
4. Account blocked, winnings cancelled, lengthy verification procedure
5. Lately, sports betting sites like Winamax, Unibet, Betclick, and others have been pointed out by bettors
6. I'm going to tell you about this bug on sports betting sites that cancels tickets as soon as they're winning
7. To take your money, guys, they're always there, and as soon as it's time to pay and it's a large sum, they cancel the bets
8. I still won €300 on Winamax
9. Winamax, welcome to those who like to win
10. Recently, the Winamax site lost a lawsuit after refusing to pay out the €400,000 won by one of its players
11. My client was accused of winning too much
12. Even the Winamax operator said that he had less chance of succeeding in such a bet in sports betting than winning the lottery
13. And the judge retorted that maybe they were planning to offer only losing bets
14. Many bettors claim to have been banned or temporarily blocked after obtaining a substantial sum
15. The story talks about a day when I put €500 PSF card on the Winamax account
16. So PSF card bought in France and I play poker
17. Play poker for days, days, days
18. One week later, I'm at €6000
19. So then, I request a withdrawal
20. I see that it's taking time
21. So I send a message directly to Winamax's customer service
22. At that time, the customer service is clear with Ruben
23. He will receive his money within 3 working days
24. But it turns out that the request ultimately takes longer for a more in-depth investigation
25. Hello Ruben, following your request, we inform you that your file is still being studied by our security service
26. We are not, however, able to communicate regarding the processing of this file
27. These investigations would be launched when the betting site doubts the user's actions, such as fraud using a robot
28. credit card fraud, fraud with a loyalty advantage
29. In short, if you know the result of the bet before anyone else or if you bet in a group
30. Sometimes bettors, like all of us on social networks, talk about the great offers from operators
31. So they're going to say "Hey, look, Kylian Mbappé is going to score a goal, look at the odds, they're great, they're better than the others"
32. Everyone is going to bet on it, but the operators are going to use it to say "Ah, but you made exactly the same bet as someone else for the same amount"
33. And that's considered fraud if you will
34. in French law, this is called a potestative or abusive clause, and in reality, a legal consequence cannot depend on only one of the parties
35. And these clauses are often vague because they're written by the site and interpreted by the same site in a way that confuses the player suspected of fraud and discourages them from taking legal action
36. We think that taking on Winamax is quite complicated, you see
37. It's a very, very large company
38. It's going to cost a lot in lawyer's fees, a lot of time because we know the French justice system is not fast
39. So it's quite dissuasive
40. It's extremely hard for them because usually, it's the first time they're going to court and they require the services of a lawyer
41. The bettor doesn't even know this risk of legal proceedings
42. In the end, when they bet, they don't imagine for a second that it's going to end up in court
43. And if the client manages to go to court, some operators manage to escape French law by establishing their company in tax havens like Malta
44. Malta is a judicial paradise, and it's very difficult to serve French court documents in Malta
45. And so some operators hide behind Maltese authorities to say "I didn't receive the judgment, so I don't have to comply"
46. In reality, checks can sometimes be random to allow operators to spread out their payments
47. There's a rule, it's the player return rate rule
48. In clear terms, this rule requires sports betting sites not to pay out winnings exceeding 85% of the amounts staked by their players over the last 6 months
49. For example, if a bookmaker receives €100 million in bets over this period, the maximum amount of winnings they can pay out is €85 million
50. The player return rate rule allows the National Gaming Authority to sanction an operator that doesn't respect this rule
51. Operators have a mechanism of not paying out winnings because otherwise, they'll exceed this ceiling
52. So big bettors, big winners aren't paid
53. Far from the beautiful promises of these sports betting sites
54. It's a penalty, really
55. €6000 can really help them pay off debts, save a family, and everything
56. So it's not fair
57. There are two measuring points
58. If you're a losing player, no problem
59. You can play multiple times
60. As long as you lose, there's no problem
61. But as soon as you win, that's when it becomes a problem for the operator
62. So it's always the same reflex
63. The rule to observe and the first question to ask is whether the bettor has a winning or losing profile?
