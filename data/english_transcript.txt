1. You remember the 2015 videos of American product tastings on YouTube
2. We ordered some, I bought Jelly Belly and well, forget my American market and my candy shop
3. These products are sold by the dozens in France
4. A store where you find all the crazy things that don't exist in France
5. I think I've found paradise on earth
6. Even mini packs of pasta, I'm talking about the ODS Store in Paris
7. Yesterday, while strolling around Paris with my best friend, we found this spot Sweet Escape
8. There were Kit Cat birthday cake kits
9. Problem is, most of these candies and other sweets are banned from sale in the European Union
10. We'll explain to you
11. There are products that are banned from sale in France
12. No, what are you talking about exactly? For example, him, yeah, yeah, after that, it's not official
13. They are sold discreetly in supermarkets near tourist areas or on this shelf of a streetwear clothing store in the heart of Paris
14. But also in sort of mega-stores of candy, soda, and chocolate
15. These are often derivative products of well-known brands like Oreo, Fanta, or M&M
16. Or American bestsellers like Lucky Charms cereal or Sour Patch Kids
17. I had seen that this drink was banned in France; it wouldn't surprise me at all if there's a Fanta that's banned
18. Even the Lucky Charms, it's because of the additives, very sugary, and yeah, surely the additives
19. Because yes, the problem with these products is the additives present in too great a quantity
20. On this label of Lucky Charms, I notice that there's the E110 coloring, which is a yellow coloring
21. There's no established concentration limit in US regulations
22. And it can also be used in any food category
23. Whereas in the European Union, it can't be used in breakfast cereals
24. There's E19, another red coloring, also not authorized for use in breakfast cereals
25. In fact, the DGCCRF recalled these cereals in 2020
26. These are colorings that can be associated with attention and concentration disorders in children
27. To the point that in the European Union, there's a mandatory mention on packaging that it can negatively affect children's activity
28. You have often discovered these points of sale on social networks
29. On TikTok, they've done so much advertising that I think we've all seen it on social networks
30. I think a bit like everyone, TikTok, but you don't really know that these products are banned
31. It's good or it's good, you know that in this store, there are products that are banned from sale in France
32. No, I didn't even know
33. Kinder, another Kinder Greek yogurt, many pistachio products that I love, pistachio
34. A strawberry Fanta, you know that strawberry Fanta is banned from sale in France
35. Ah, no, not at all, this strawberry Fanta, like Lucky Charms, doesn't comply with European regulations on food additives
36. It's overdosed with E10 coloring
37. Another problem, confectionery is often poorly labeled
38. On the American label, it's specified that there are GMO ingredients, whereas on the French label, it's not indicated at all
39. Whereas it should be mandatory
40. And second element, the palm oil ingredient is just listed in French as "palmist oil"
41. Except that on the American label below, we see that it's hydrogenated palm oil
42. But these are not the same compounds at all
43. And the cardiovascular risks are totally different
44. The risks associated with hydrogenated vegetable oils are cardiovascular risks and increased risks of developing type 2 diabetes
45. In addition to this more than dubious composition, customs controls revealed the presence of titanium dioxide in these M&Ms
46. E171, France banned the sale of products containing this additive as of 2020
47. As a precautionary principle, the European Union also banned it as of 2022
48. It's dangerous because it's suspected of being genotoxic, meaning it can alter the DNA of our cells
49. It's also suspected of being carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
50. Mars Riglet, the multinational that owns the brand, confirms that these M&Ms shouldn't be on the French market
51. This variety of peanut butter M&M's is not and has never been marketed by Mars Riglet in France
52. The varieties of M&M's we market in France are only the following: peanut, crispy, choco, caramel sale, and mini
53. It adds, more specifically regarding titanium dioxide, Mars has made the choice to remove it from all its human food products worldwide
54. It's already the case since 2020 in France and Europe
55. In clear, the group is progressively removing titanium dioxide from its confectionery
56. However, some goods sold outside the EU may still contain titanium dioxide
57. That's the case for peanut butter M&M's
58. And it's probably not an isolated case
59. Contacting French customs, they indicate that the DNRED seized more than 72 tons of these goods
60. And traced 383 additional tons imported since summer 2021
61. It remains to be seen how these specialized stores procure these banned sweets
62. In fact, it's wholesalers who import these goods and then resell them to specialized stores
63. Customs specify that often these goods don't arrive directly in France
64. But in another European country, which makes controls more difficult
65. Like it's an Italian store, they import products from Italy; I think they don't even know all the laws
66. In fact, they import everything from Italy to France
67. Contacted ODS Italia didn't respond to our requests
68. French customs estimate that around sixty references of illegal American products are currently on sale in French stores
