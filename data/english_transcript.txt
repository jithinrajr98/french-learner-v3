1. Hello and welcome to this new episode.
2. We're going to visit Montmartre today.
3. We arrived via Pigalle station, right next to Montmartre.
4. We're going to walk around the neighborhood.
5. We're moving toward the Moulin Rouge.
6. I told you we were going to walk around the neighborhood - in English, this word means the place or surrounding area.
7. If I tell you today we're in Montmartre, there are very good restaurants in the area and in the neighborhood there's also this butcher shop with rotisserie chickens that look very good.
8. They also sell cured meats.
9. I absolutely love charcuterie.
10. I really like croissants, crêpes, and pain au chocolat.
11. You already know this, but I like them even more here.
12. We're arriving at the Wall of Love.
13. The Wall of Love is written in more than 300 languages.
14. And you see what I mean, so write "I love you" in your language in the comments and don't forget to like and subscribe if you enjoy this vlog.
15. We're going up to Sacré-Cœur.
16. Sacré-Cœur is that basilica at the top.
17. You can go up by stairs or by funicular.
18. The line for the funicular is very long, so I decide to walk.
19. The stairs are very long - perfect for exercise.
20. It's more tiring than running on flat ground.
21. We're almost there and we're taking the stairs on the side.
22. There are also stairs here.
23. Here's Sacré-Cœur - very crowded today.
24. We're going to see the stairs going down - the view is magnificent.
25. You can see all of Paris.
26. Look at all these cafés and restaurants.
27. Montmartre is a unique neighborhood in Paris.
28. The view is spectacular.
29. There's a special atmosphere here, as if Montmartre belonged to another time far from modern hustle and bustle.
30. I'm going to continue walking through Montmartre's pretty little streets, which are very cute.
