8. Yeah, that's the Parisian breakfast.
9. Where did you buy the pain au chocolat?

11. So, you go out every morning to buy a pain au chocolat from the bakery?
12. And you've been in Paris for a long time?
13. Um, 11 years now.
14. Yeah, that's quite a while.
15. And where are you from, if that's not indiscreet?
16. Australia.
17. What did you have for breakfast this morning?
18. I actually had a coffee with milk and a croissant.
19. That's a classic breakfast for you, right?
20. No, no, no, because at home, I'm actually from Belgium.
21. I live between Ghent and Brussels, and normally I don't eat in the morning.
22. I do a sort of intermittent fasting.
23. Yes, that's it, that's it in French.
24. What did you have for breakfast?
25. Hot chocolate and toast.
26. Hot chocolate and toast, and what was on the toast?
27. Well, jam or honey and butter.
28. What kind of jam, raspberry?
29. Is that your favorite jam?
30. What did you have for breakfast this morning?
31. So, yogurt, tea, toasted bread with cereal, butter, and honey.
32. Is that a classic breakfast you often have?
33. Always the same, with a bit of orange juice sometimes.
34. So, I'm a sporty person, so it's a sort of big pancake, banana, eggs, mixed oats.
35. That's it, all cooked in a pan.
36. That's a big, protein-rich pancake, exactly.
37. Is that your breakfast every morning, or does it change sometimes?
38. It's often that, or with some white cheese.
39. So, I had omelets, a protein shake, and some almonds.
40. What's a protein shake?
41. Protein.
42. Some almonds, is that a classic breakfast for you?
43. Yeah, I'm doing sports this period, and I want my belly to disappear.
44. So, I'm being careful, it's for the "winter body".
45. Yeah, that's it, taking care of oneself.
46. You see, I'm 47, and at that age, you have to be a bit careful.
47. Croissants and stuff, I try to avoid as much as possible.
48. I had a chocolate croissant and a slice of lemon cake.
49. Is that what you have every morning?
50. Um, no, usually it's more Greek yogurt with muesli, but since I'm in Paris, I might as well take advantage of it.
51. Where are you from, if that's not indiscreet?
52. I live in Kansas City, Missouri, in the United States.
53. Did you grow up there?
54. No, I'm from Besancon, I grew up there.
55. Yeah, toast and tea.
56. Is that your classic breakfast?
57. Absolutely, every day, no matter what.
58. And what do you put on your toast?
59. That's a fascinating question.
60. Um, a bit of butter, honey, maybe jam.
61. What did you have for breakfast this morning?
62. Oh, it was a disaster, I was really late, so just a banana, literally.
63. And now I'm rushing to buy something to eat because I'm starving after my morning.
64. Not even a coffee, well, I did have a coffee, always a coffee, but it was a disaster.
65. It's not what I usually eat.
66. What do you usually eat?
67. I love bread and butter, it's my religion, plus I'm Breton, so I eat salted butter all the time.
68. And what kind of bread do you like?
69. Simple traditional baguette, always the little flour, and that's perfect.

74. I had tea, chocolate, and then toast with almost the same things, different jams.
75. But with each toast, I changed, so I put honey on one toast, lavender honey on another, apricot jam on another, and blueberry jam on another.
76. Wow, that's copious.
77. And do you have a different breakfast on the weekends compared to weekdays?
78. It depends, sometimes we have croissants or something else that Dad goes to buy.
79. Well, pains au chocolat.
80. Yes, say it, pains au chocolat.
81. Which do you prefer, croissants or pains au chocolat?
82. I prefer pains au chocolat, me too.

87. And did you drink something?
88. A bowl of hot chocolate, exactly.

90. Yes, he has orange juice, apple juice, and that's it.
91. And do you have a more copious breakfast on the weekends?
92. Well, on Sundays, it's viennoiseries, so not chocolate.
93. And who's going to buy the viennoiseries?
94. Um, Dad or Mom, it depends, or Grandpa when he's there.
95. Yeah, and on the weekends, do you have bigger, more copious breakfasts?
96. Sometimes, if I'm with friends, we have a brunch.
97. And what do you usually have in a brunch?
98. Um, well, eggs, avocado toast, things like that, more luxurious, more chic.
99. And do you have a different, more copious breakfast on the weekends?

101. And what makes up your typical brunch?
102. It's often savory, sweet, and a lot of alcohol in the morning.
103. Yes, at what time do you usually have brunch, between 11 am and 1 pm?
104. And what kind of alcohol do you drink?
105. Well, often mimosas, or it can be beer, gin and tonic.
106. Can you give the composition of a mimosa?
107. Yes, it's champagne and orange juice.
108. Yeah, and do you have a favorite place to go for brunch?
109. Oh, without making it too much of a plug, Holly Belly, in the 10th, near Jacques Bonsergent.
110. And on the weekends, do you have more copious breakfasts as a family, or is it the same?
111. Well, I'm alone, so I think it's exactly the same.
112. But when I go back to my family, my Dad always gets all the viennoiseries.
113. So, breakfast as a family is always with viennoiseries.
114. So, that's cool, you're from Brittany, if that's not indiscreet?
115. I'm from near Rennes.
116. I don't know if you're familiar with the Broceliande forest.
117. Well, I live in the forest.
118. Wow, okay, so it's cool, I feel like I have two lives, between Paris and Brittany.
119. And do you go back there often?
120. Well, once every three weeks, I would say, I need to recharge, nature, all that, it's good for me.
