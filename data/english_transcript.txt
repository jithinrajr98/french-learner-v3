1. We respect the highway code.
2. We are on a four-lane road.
3. It's just people who work, they're not road delinquents.
4. We already lose time in Paris, we can't drive anymore.
5. Now it's the périphérique, we really wonder if it's going to remain somewhere we can drive.
6. It's 5:19 in the morning, it's October 10th, so it's official, the périphérique is entirely at 50 km/h.
7. It's almost dangerous to drive at 50 at night or early in the morning.
8. We're on the busiest axis in France.
9. We're on a four-lane road, there are over a million vehicles that pass here per day.
10. The only time people slow down is when they arrive in front of the radar on the périphérique.
11. It would have been much more logical to set specific hours when you can't exceed 50 km/h.
12. After that, set hours when you can drive faster, but 70 was very very good.
13. It was neither too fast nor too slow, it was really ideal, 70.
14. But 50 is frustrating, it's frustrating.
15. I go home, I'm fed up, I come to work, I'm fed up.
16. There's not a single moment when we're calm.
17. I don't look ahead on the périphérique today, I look behind, I check if someone is going to crash into us.
18. Those who are awake all night, how do they do it?
19. We have a unanimous decision from the city of Paris.
20. There are no pedestrians, there are no bicycles, so what's the point?
21. But I know very well what's the point, it's that in a few years they'll put us at 30 km/h.
22. They'll put a bike lane and the loop will be closed, simply.
23. They'll put little trees like that, we can look at trees while we drive, simply.
24. We already lose time in Paris, we can't drive anymore.
25. Three-quarters of accidents on the périphérique involve a two-wheeled vehicle, generally.
26. It's never between cars, it's very rare.
27. A vehicle that doesn't move, for me it's simple, it's a vehicle that pollutes.
28. It would have been much more logical to put a soundproof coating.
29. Something that already exists and that we have on a certain part of the périphérique and it makes a real difference.
30. We always prefer to target those who work.
31. Those who work, it's just adding to the hardship, simply.
32. In terms of mental load, we're at our limit.
33. Even in terms of life expectancy, it's going to be okay.
34. We've probably lost a few years, we're stressed, anxious from morning to night.
35. The average speed of Parisian taxis is constantly decreasing.
36. Today, clients at the end of every ride say not "good day" anymore, they say "good luck, sir".
37. Because people know very well what we go through from morning to night.
38. We have a consultation scheduled for December with the City Hall of Paris with taxi unions.
39. If I note that there's no improvement for us Parisian taxi drivers who are no more no less than the continuity of public service.
40. If I wait, I think I'll finish paying for my car and then I'll do like many taxi colleagues.
41. They switched to suburban taxi because the mental load is too high.
42. We're exhausted, or I'll change profession.
43. Listen, if they don't want us, what do you want us to do?
44. We won't force things, we transport clients and try to make people use their vehicles less.
45. Logically, it should have an advantage, but these promises have always been made, but we've never seen the color.
46. If we have this policy of not wanting vehicles in Paris, let's assume it.
47. If you don't want individual vehicles in Paris, ban vehicles.
48. But stop making people go crazy, we'll really end up, we'll all end up in the asylum.
