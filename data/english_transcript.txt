1. A good idea is to put back the towers of the Bassie with moats and and and drawbridges.
2. That way, you're sure that no one is going to enter and we, we're going to leave.
3. I myself have resold all my furniture, my anti-theft system, I'm emptying it because next Monday, I'm handing over the keys to this shop.
4. Why am I stopping?
5. First of all, because effectively, at a certain point, I no longer want to fight against windmills.
6. I saw what's happening.
7. We tried to explain to them what they're doing.
8. Well, they're completely transforming the neighborhood and the clientele of the neighborhood.
9. Here, we're on Rue du Temple.
10. It's true that since 2017, when the new municipal team arrived, with the closure of the quays, we saw the disappearance of all the clientele from West Paris.
11. Then, there was Covid and we had the closure of Rue Rivoli, suppression of parking spaces, proliferation of bicycle lanes everywhere, and so on.
12. In 2023, a new obstacle: the Paris City Hall imposes a new traffic plan in the Marais labyrinth, a real labyrinth.
13. Their idea is to eliminate transition traffic.
14. This means that someone going from north to south can't do it because the more you complicate things, the more you discourage people from coming.
15. Have you loaded everything, Mine?
16. Yeah.
17. I set up here in 2010.
18. It was a street to become something.
19. We developed it, we gave a boost to the neighborhood because it's true that we opened on Sundays and all the foreign brands that want to establish themselves in Paris.
20. In 99% of cases, they ask for the Marais.
21. And today, in the Marais, they ask for Rue du Temple in 90% of cases.
22. Don't hold on.
23. If not only don't hold on because the economy is complicated, but it's true that if they put obstacles in our way, we won't be able to hold on.
24. They imposed on us after the Paris Respire in 2024, they had the good idea of creating the ZTL, a limited traffic zone.
25. Now, we've completely barricaded the center and as I told them, you have one thing left, a good idea is to put back the towers of the Bassie with moats and and and drawbridges.
26. That way, you're sure that no one is going to enter and we, we're going to leave.
27. They said, "Okay, we're going to create a ZTN, and then how are you going to control it?"
28. We'll do random checks or at the exit.
29. Okay.
30. How are you going to do it?
31. You're going to stop people who are leaving in their cars.
32. First of all, on what grounds?
33. Move over.
34. Good day, sir, where are you coming from?
35. From BHV.
36. Do you have a receipt?
37. Well, I remind you that now we don't give receipts anymore.
38. I don't know what you want.
39. And then, well, I didn't buy anything, I didn't find anything.
40. What do we do?
41. See a friend, but they don't know how to do it.
42. They applied it and then they thought about it.
43. At the last meeting at the voirie, there were all the parking lot managers because they say that customers can't get to the parking lot.
44. We've had a 17 to 20% decrease.
45. All this is done because people aren't coming, so they're walking less.
46. Effectively, before Sundays, we needed 5 or 6 people in the store.
47. They ended up with two.
48. This means that they don't want you to cross the neighborhood.
49. We filed a complaint against the ZL.
50. They replied to us, "Yes, it's always the same people who complain because they didn't know how to adapt to the internet."
51. On the other hand, there are many Uber delivery people and it's not very ecological, you know.
52. You see all the poor delivery people on Saturdays and Sundays with Camenbert delivering Zalando, Amazon, and so on.
53. Effectively, there's a change.
54. Maybe I'm old.
55. I told them, "Be careful, the repercussions of what you're doing are irreversible."
56. We can't go back.
57. We'll see you soon, Patrick.
58. Thanks.
59. Yeah, it's great.
60. We're good now.
61. That was one of my happy suppliers.
62. He's sad that I'm stopping, but he's understood.
63. I'm stuck.
64. Yeah, and that's exactly it.
65. It's really that.
66. It's a beautiful person with great values and you have to fight, but in the end, there's always a voice of reason, commerce, and that's professionally, you're going to miss us a lot because you've been an inspiring person who has inspired us a lot, it's a reference, it's always sport.
67. We still believe in this job, that's why we're here.
68. Yeah.
69. Yeah, there are things to do, but you have to adapt.
70. You have to adapt.
71. Well, goodbye, Mine, see you soon.
72. And then there's this bike mentality in Paris where they have all the rights, you have to be very careful.
73. It's dangerous to allow bikes to pass through in the wrong direction.
74. We've given them all the rights, red lights, changes.
75. On the other hand, when we're on scooters, if we take a small bike lane, we get in trouble, we become delinquents because it's so absurd.
76. I think that effectively, on the big axes, leave them, okay, you make a bike lane, not four bike lanes like Rue de Rivoli.
77. As he says, it's shared space, I shared it, we don't share anything.
78. Well, that's the policy of the Paris City Hall.
79. No consultation.
80. Every time we were invited to so-called consultation meetings, the mass was said, but what's regrettable is that we can't work with them so you understand because the Marais neighborhood, we've been there for 40 years.
81. We're part of those who developed it a bit.
82. Today, it's nicer to go to small shops where you have the retailer who tells his story, who does his thing, than to go to chain stores, I'm not going to name brands, but they're on every corner.
83. It's not the same job.
84. Alright, see you later.
85. Phew!
86. Ah, it's good.
87. I feel a little pang in my heart, though.
88. 15 years, you have to turn left there.
89. That's why I didn't give up.
90. No, I'm moving on to another stage of my life.
91. I still want to do things, you know.
92. In the morning when I wake up, I still have, how do you say?
93. I still have the energy to do things.
94. Maybe not running the store.
95. It required more and more energy.
96. 68 years old.
97. Uh, I've been retired for 2 years.
98. Uh, is it still worth it?
99. My staff who's there, who's an extraordinary team, they understand, effectively, economic layoff, that's it.
100. Uh, I think I did things the way I had to.
101. Alright.
102. There, that was my office and the archives, we stored them elsewhere because I had several years of archives.
103. We try to give some things away and then throw the rest away.
104. I would have liked to sell the business, that way it would have allowed me to maybe keep the employee, it would have allowed me to keep the same rent, it would have allowed me to continue.
105. My best business card is the seniority of my staff.
106. Thierry has been working with me since 1996.
107. Maria, 25 years, it means the soup is good.
108. Alright, well, that's it.
109. In December 2025, with lawyer Alain Win, we filed a complaint against the ZTL.
110. But this time, we were joined by federations, including the Alliance Commerce Federation, which represents big stores that are outside the ZTL but they know very well the impact of this ZTL effect which puts in people's minds and you can talk to people from the suburbs, we don't come to Paris anymore because it's not possible, we don't come, the menuisier this morning who came to unload, he told me "I come but you give me a key because I'm going to come at 5 am."
111. I don't enter Paris at 8 or 9 am.
112. It's dead.
113. I think that there are tactical errors.
114. Alright, at every meeting, and that's tiring, they pull out a PowerPoint with Nantes and Grenoble as examples.
115. Nantes, I don't know if you've been there, I went there.
116. It's become a pedestrian center with, excuse the expression, punk dogs, whereas it was a beautiful city.
117. No, but they cite it every time as an example, and let's not talk about Grenoble because it's a Kalashnikov.
118. The last time, he wanted to pull out the PowerPoint and I said no.
119. That's enough, we know it by heart, let's discuss seriously, how are you going to apply your ZTL?
120. And then he turns to me and says, "But precisely, we're here to ask for your ideas."
121. It's a joke.
122. I think you're not ready.
123. So before applying something, think, let's work together and then you apply.
124. And the BHV that was sold, then?
125. Yes, it was sold.
126. It's a sad story because it was sold to two people that I tried to contact.
127. And it's true that the closure of the quays, plus the clientele from the West, closure of Rivoli, -20% in sales.
128. So they decided to sell.
129. Amazing, is it going to be transformed into a hotel, offices, and so on?
130. It'll be another slap in the face for Madame Hidalgo to say, "See, what you're doing has repercussions."
131. Commerce is life.
132. And when you kill commerce, you kill life.
