1. We lose our money because in any case it's done on purpose, the codes are calculated on purpose so that it's always the same person who wins.
2. Even if we manage to win our money, it's very complicated to recover it.
3. Account blocked, winnings cancelled, lengthy verification procedure.
4. We always see the same message.
5. Yes, our security service is currently processing your ongoing file.
6. Recently, sports betting sites like Winamax, Unibet, Betclick and others have been pointed out by bettors.
7. To take your money, the guys are always there, and as soon as it's time to pay and it's a large sum, they cancel the bets.
8. Actions that are far from respecting the promise of these betting sites.
9. Recently, the Winamax site lost its lawsuit after refusing to pay out the €400,000 won by one of its players.
10. My client was accused of winning too much.
11. Even the Winamax operator had said that he had less chance of succeeding in such a sports betting coup than winning the lottery.
12. And the judge retorted that maybe they were planning to offer only losing bets.
13. A case that is far from being isolated on social media.
14. Many bettors claim to have been banned or temporarily blocked after obtaining a substantial sum.
15. At that moment, the customer service is clear with Ruben.
16. He will receive his money within 3 working days.
17. But the request ultimately takes longer for a more in-depth investigation.
18. Following your request, we inform you that your file is still being studied by our security service.
19. We are however unable to communicate the processing time for this file.
20. These investigations would be launched when the betting site doubts the actions of its user, such as fraud using a robot, credit card fraud, or fraud with unfair advantage.
21. In other words, if you know the result of the bet before anyone else, or if you bet in a group.
22. In French law, this is called a potestative or abusive clause, and in reality, a legal consequence cannot depend on only one of the parties.
23. And these clauses are often vague because they are written by the site and interpreted by the same site in a way to confuse the player suspected of fraud and dissuade them from taking legal action.
24. We think that taking on Winamax is quite complicated, you know.
25. It's going to cost lawyer's fees, a lot of time, because we know the French justice system is not fast.
26. So it's quite discouraging.
27. The bettor doesn't even know the risk of judicial proceedings.
28. Ultimately, when he bets, he doesn't imagine for a second that it will end up in court.
29. And if the customer manages to go to court, some operators manage to escape French law by establishing their company in tax havens like Malta.
30. Malta is a judicial paradise, and it's very difficult to serve French documents in Malta.
31. There is a rule, it's the player return rate rule.
32. In clear terms, this rule requires sports betting sites not to pay out winnings exceeding 85% of the amounts staked by their players over the last 6 months.
33. For example, if during this period a bookmaker receives €100 million in bets, the maximum amount of winnings he can pay out is €85 million.
34. The player return rate rule allows the National Gaming Authority to sanction an operator who does not respect this rule.
35. Operators use one of the mechanisms, which is not to pay out winnings because otherwise, you will exceed this ceiling.
36. So big bettors, big winners are not paid.
37. Far from, therefore, the fine promises of these sports betting sites.
38. It's a penalty, really.
39. There's €6000 that can really save them from drowning in debt, save a family and everything.
40. So it's not fair.
41. If you're a losing player, no problem.
42. You can play multiple times.
43. As long as you lose, there's no problem.
44. But as soon as you win, that's when it becomes a problem for the operator.
45. The rule to observe and the first question to ask is, does the bettor have a winning or losing profile?
